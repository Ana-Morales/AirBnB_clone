## Installation

To use the command line interpreter it is necessary to install it by using the following commands from your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/Ana-Morales/AirBnB_clone.git

This will create a new directory named "AirBnB_clone", now move to the directory using:

    AirBnB_clone/

Now you will be inside the AirBnB_clone directory and you will see different files. These files are python modules or folders that contain other modules.

Congrats, now you have our cmd line interpreter running in your machine.

## Use

In order to execute this cmd line interpreter just type from your terminal the command

    ./console.py

It will open a prompt and it will look like this

    (hbnb) 

You are on the cmd line interpreter and it is waiting for you to type and execute a command. Next you will see a list of commands.
